- Top #3 unchanged with EMPIRE looking more secure in the #1 spot.
- Rumors of some shady activities seems to have resulted in  INVICTUS imploding which has put an abrupt halt to their ascendancy in the rankings.  Would not be surprised if they drop out of the Top 10, but this may take a while given the new methodology.
- Some shuffling of positions in #4-#6, but more a reflection of the ranking period window than this monthâ€™s performance.
- Many strong players joining Vortex may mean that they will become the ascendant team.
- For 2025, the INVICTUS drama has meant that EMPIRE has taken the lead! However NORTH is breathing down their necksâ€¦
