#### Monthly Team Boss Chest

Rewards vary depending on the level of the chest at the end of the month. Teams start the month at Level 1 and need to beat 6 Bosses in total to reach Level 2.  The Bosses required increases alternating between four or two for each additional level e.g. 10 Bosses to go from Level 2 to Level 3, 12 Bosses to go from Level 3 to Level 4, 14 Bosses to go from Level 4 to Level 5, etc.
 
***Gems:*** Gems awarded start at 15 for Level 1 and increase by 5 for each level until they hit the cap of 60 (Level 10).

***Coins:*** Coins start at 30000 for Level 1 and increase by 10000 for each level until they hit the cap of 120000 (Level 10).

***Research Points:*** Research Points start at 500 for Level 1 and increase by 500 for each level until they hit the cap of 5000 (Level 10).  

***Parts:*** Parts awarded are random but do step up at specific levels.  Parts awarded are similar to the following chests:

Level | Chest
:--: | :--
1-2 | **Common** (at least 18 common and 2 rare part)
3-5 | **Uncommon** (at least 29 common and 2 rare parts)
6-9 | **Rare** (at least 45 common and 6 rare parts)
10 | **Epic** (at least 68 common, 9 rare and 6 epic parts)

Accordingly, there is an incentive to reach Level 10 in order to secure epic parts for all team members
