The August update for Hill Climb Racing 2 is rolling out now for all supported platforms! Coming in this update is the Switchback Savanna; full of wonders of the wilds, and get ready for more Vehicle Mastery with Bus, Lowrider, Chopper and Tractor!  

- Vehicle Mastery for Bus, Lowrider, Chopper and Tractor
> How it works: Fully upgrade your vehicle to max stats (20, 20, 20, and 20), and then you can start to collect XP for that specific vehicle. Each vehicle has four mastery levels, which you’ll progress through by collecting XP. To progress through mastery levels, you need powerful tune parts in addition to XP, and you can buy the next upgrade with coins. XP can’t be stockpiled.
> How to earn XP:
> - Distances in adventure levels
> - Cup finish positions
> - Public event positions
> - Community event positions
> - Team Match single-level score
> - Featured challenge won
> - Doing tricks (wheelie, flips, air time)
> - Specific vehicle mechanics (Bus: Removing Passengers, Lowrider: Using Fully Charged Jump Shocks, Chopper: not picking up fuel can, Tractor: Break Objects).

- Blueprint balance changes
