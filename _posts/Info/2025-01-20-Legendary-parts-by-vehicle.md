Legendary Parts are the most difficult to obtain. Recent vehicles with more legendary parts are less likely to have been maxed.  Accordingly, it can be argued that these vehicles are more justified in buying legendary chests for. On the other hand, if the missing parts are less favored, then legendary chests may be better value-for-money.  

1. All vehicles have Coin Boost
2. Glider also has Fuel Boost, whereas CCEV has Thruster
3. Vehicles with three parts are all missing Thruster
