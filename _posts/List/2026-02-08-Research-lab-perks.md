The Research Lab can be found via the bottom-left button on fhe Teams Tab. This is where Research Points can be spent to benefit the whole team.   

Research Points are obtained from team chests, completing team matches, and from the Team Shop (make sure to collect the 100 ad/VIP research points each day).  

There are 12 Team Perks available split between 4 Tiers. Initially only the first tier is available. The first three tiers each have three permanant boosts and a single once-off reward, whereas the fourth tier has two of each. The overall Lab Level is increased by upgrading the permanent boosts. Higher tiers become available at Lab Levels 8, 18, and 32 respectively. The most efficent way to reach these levels is as follows:  

Tier 2: 2 x Level 3 + 1 x Level 2  
Tier 3: 6 x Level 3  
Tier 4: 5 x Level 4 + 4 x Level 3  

The costs increase significantly by level for each permanent boost. Each level upgrade costs roughly twice that of the prior level upgrade.  As a result, the research points required to reach Tier 3 from Tier 2 is around 1.5x that required to reach Tier 2; similarly, the research points needed to reach Tier 4 from Tier 3 is around 1.5x the total required to reach Tier 3 from Tier 1!  

Accordingly, higher tiers take increasing long to reach (see graphs below for cost of reaching higher boost levels and tiers).
