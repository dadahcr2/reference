We are an open team, so no password.  If there is a spot available and the below resonates with you, you are very welcome to join (7500+GP) - or feel free to join our even more relaxed team: **Gas Brake GoÂ²** (Note: **Gas Brake GoÂ²** currently on a break).

1. **We are an active and friendly team.** There are no hard rules, but participating in all team matches and 100+km a week are good signs of activity. We try to keep it clean, be respectful, and support one another. 

2. **Real life takes priority.** If you have a problem preventing you from playing, let the team know. We are extremely understanding.

3. **In-game chat** is the primary means of communication. Nevertheless, we also have a well maintained [discord server](https://discord.gg/8qk5Mmwd) and website: <https://reference.hcr2info.com>.

4. **Relax and have fun!**  Rankings are secondary.

5. **Eat plenty fiber!!** ðŸ˜€
