The May update for Hill Climb Racing 2 is rolling out now for all supported platforms! Prepare yourself for Vehicle Mastery, which will exhilarate the end game and take you to new heights! We also have a bunch of cool new features roaring around the corner, like new cups locations, a new level theme, and so much more!

- New Feature: Vehicle Mastery
  
  How it works:
  > Fully upgrade your vehicle to max stats (20, 20, 20, and 20), and then you can start to collect XP for that specific vehicle. Each vehicle has four mastery levels, which you’ll progress through by collecting XP. To progress through mastery levels, you need powerful tune parts in addition to XP, and you can buy the next upgrade with coins. XP can’t be stockpiled.
  
  How to earn XP:
  - Distances in adventure levels
  - Cup finish positions
  - Public event positions
  - Community event positions
  - Team Match single-level score
  - Featured challenge won
  - Doing tricks (wheelie, flips, air time)
  - Specific vehicle mechanics (Sports Car: drive full speed on the ground; Moonlander: use the thrusters; Racing Truck: drive aerodynamically; monowheel: get big air time).
  - Opening vehicle-specific chests  
    
  > The vehicles for mastery will be released staggered. The first vehicle available for mastery is the Sports Car, which will be followed by (in no particular order): Monowheel, Moon Lander, and Racing Truck.

  Mastery levels and rewards:
  - There are four mastery levels to progress through by earning XP.
  - Level 1-3: Unlock permanent buffs for your vehicles, featuring general power and vehicle-specific buffs. All buffs can be toggled on or off.
  - Level 4: Unlocks a fourth tuning part slot for your vehicle.

- New Level Theme: Savanna
- New Cups: The Jungle Brake, A Bit Plain, Racers In The Mist
- Vehicle chests
  - Earn vehicle-specific chests from vehicle-specific daily- and distance tasks
- Cups chest from every finish position
- Removed entry fee from Forest Trials, Intense City, and Raging Winter
