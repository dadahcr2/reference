**Note :** Current ranking system has been changed to be more similar to the calendar total i.e. giving equals weight to each of the last 12 months, rather than decreasing the weights for older months.   This way there is a “last year” total and a “year-to-date calendar” total, which would obviously be the same in December.  The impact of this is that it will be a little slower for teams to climb up the rankings, but the results will be more consistent and credible in reflecting strength over the last year.o
