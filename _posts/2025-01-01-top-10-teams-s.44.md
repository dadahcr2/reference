# 2024 Calendar Season Result  
🥇 EMPIRE  
🥈 Project GER  
🥉 Unity  

**Note :** the thought for 2025 is to convert the current ranking system to be more similar to the calendar total i.e. giving equals weight to each of the last 12 months, rather than decreasing the weights for older months.   This way there would be a “last year” total and a “year-to-date calendar” total, which would obviously be the same in December.  Please feel free to let me know what you think?
