These numbers may be updated as more data is collected.  The underlying data is available [here](/chestdata/)

#### Order of cup chests

**Cup chests** have a specific sequence:

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/hillclimbracing2_gamepedia_en/images/2/2b/111_Cup_Chests_Order.PNG)  

This is made up of 87 Common(3h), 3 Uncommon(6h), 18 Rare(8h), 2 Epic(12h) and 1 Champion(24h) Chest  

- All chests, other than common, are always followed by a common chest  
- 72.4% of common chests are followed by another one

In terms of consecutive common chests, percentages as follows:  

Percent | Minimum number of common chests
:--: | :--
96% | at least 2 common chests  
75% | at least 3 common chests  
50% | at least 4 common chests  
37.5% | at least 5 common chests  
4% | 6 common chests  

#### Relative Value of Cup Chests

> Average coins earned are divided by 200 as this is the amount of scrap coins can be converted to if used to buy common or rare parts in the shop  

Similarly, the following chart indicates the relative acrap value of buying chests and alternatives in the PE Shop

The following indicates expected payoffs using 5000 gems to earn chests in cup races

Per 5000 gems | Minimum | Average  
:--: | :--: | :--:  
Coins | 1,200,239 | 1,457,564  
Common | 7,197 | 8,677

####  Adventure Chests

The gems, coins, and parts vary based on the level of the chest. The level of the chest depends in the distance travelled. For normal maps, Level 1 Is reached at 500m, and increases by 1 for every additional 500m.  For the hard maps (Intense City, Forest Trials, and Raging Winter), Level 1 is reached at 100m and increases by 1 for every additional 100m.

***Gems:*** One gem is earned at Level 1, a second at Level 4, and an additional one every fourth level thereafter; however, for the hard maps, the second gem is earned at Level 5, and an additional one every fifth level thereafter.  Total gems are capped at 8 per run.

***Coins:*** Coins earned are 1000 + 400 coins for every level.  The first chest level is achieved by reaching 500m, and the level goes up every 500m thereafter; however, for the hard maps, levels are incremented every 100m and coins increase by 200 for each level.
Additional coins are earned if a duplicated paint/skin would have been awarded (common=1000 coins, rare=2000 coins).

***Parts:*** Parts awarded from adventure chests are variable but step up at certain levels with parts similar to that of the following chests:	

Level | Chest
:--: | :--
 1-6 |	**Common** (at least 18 common and 2 rare parts)
 7-12 | **Uncommon** (at least 29 common 2 rare parts)
 13+ |	**Rare** (at least 45 common and 6 rare parts)

The parts awarded differ for the hard maps (Intense City, Forest Trials, and Raging Winter):

Level | Chest
:--: | :--
 1-5 | **Common** (at least 18 common and 2 rare parts)
 6+ | **Uncommon** (at least 29 common 2 rare parts)

Accordingly, from a parts perspective, it appears best to at least reach 6500m (Level 13 chest), except for the three hard maps, where there is no improvement in parts beyond 600m i.e. Level 6.

#### Trove Chests

There are 90 key points available; 18 from each of five different adventure maps.  Each level has one 7️⃣ key, two 3️⃣ keys and five 1️⃣ keys.  For every 10 key points, a new trove chest is opened. Higher level trove chests have better rewards as follows:

Level | Chest
:--: | :--
 1-2 |	**Uncommon** (at least 29 common 2 rare parts)
 3-5 |	**Rare** (at least 45 common and 6 rare parts)
 6-7 | **Epic** (at least 68 common, 9 rare and 6 epic parts)
 8-9 | **Champion** (at least 113 common and 12 epic parts - 60% legendary)

#### Weekly Team Chest

Rewards vary depending on the level of the chest at the end of the week. Teams start the week at Level 1 and need to travel 65km in total to reach Level 2.  The distance required increases by 30km for each additional level e.g. 95km to go from Level 2 to Level 3, 125km to go from Level 3 to Level 4, etc.
 
***Gems:*** Gems awarded start at 7 for Level 1 and increase by 2 for each level until they hit the cap of 50 (Level 23+).

***Coins:*** Coins start at 24000 for Level 1 and increase by 4000 for each level until they hit the cap of 200000 (Level 45+).

***Parts:*** Parts awarded are random but do step up at specific levels.  Parts awarded are similar to the following chests:

Level | Chest
:--: | :--
1-2 | **Common** (at least 18 common and 2 rare part)
3-5 | **Uncommon** (at least 29 common and 2 rare parts)
6-9 | **Rare** (at least 45 common and 6 rare parts)
10-13 | **Epic** (at least 68 common, 9 rare and 6 epic parts)
14-17 | **Champion** (at least 113 common and 12 epic parts)
18+ | **Legendary** (at least 113 common, 12 epic and 3 legendary parts)

Accordingly, there is a strong incentive to reach Level 18 in order to secure legendary parts for all team members

On completing the season (50k), the chest will start at level 1. The level of the chest will go up by one for each additional 1k traveled beyond 50k on the trophy road until level 200 (249k)

***Gems:*** Gems awarded start at 11 for Level 1 and increase by 1 for each additional level up to a maximum of 210 gems at level 200.
