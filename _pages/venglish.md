Is it ok for me to make a few English suggestions for you to keep in mind for your tutorials.  The words you use make sense but there are sometimes other words that would be used more commonly?

- Rather than “obligatory”, use “necessary”
- “Penultimate” → “second best” or  “second highest”
- “clamp” → “step on”

Was definitely an improvement this week especially not using “clamp” 👍

- “make a flip back” → “make a backflip”
- “passage” → “route”
- “get acceleration” → “accelerate”

I hope you don’t mind my English suggestions 😁
Here are a few minor comments:

- In general, “accelerate” is a verb.  As a noun use “acceleration” e.g. “good acceleration” -  or “accelerator” if referring to the thing that leads to acceleration.
- “With a Slight deviation backwards” → “leaning slightly backwards”
- “With step on accelerate” → “while accelerating”
- “We step on accelerate” → “we accelerate” or “we step on gas” or “we step on the accelerator” (English is not an easy language. The way you phrased it was not too bad.)
 - “Hillock” → “hill” or “small hill” (hillock is not a commonly used word)
- “flew” is past tense.  Use “fly” if present tense.

The English was pretty good this week 👍 - a few very minor points
- “make a tilt” → “tilt”
- for CC-EV it is called “boost” and not “momentum” in the game
- “step on two pedals” → “step on both pedals” - “two” is ok but might imply that there are more than two in total.

**The Canyon Job** 
- fly forward "on a given trajectory" -> "along the given trajectory" or  "in the shown direction"
- "the most important first jump" -> "the first jump is the most important"
- "improve your jump shocks" - this is ok but "upgrade your jump shocks" would be even better
- "point of landing" -> "landing point" sounds better
- "memorize the relief of the track" - "relief" is not commonly used.  Maybe "memorize the shape of the track surface"?
- "the essense of the route ..."-> "in essence..." is suffient
- "land on the descent of the slide" -> "land on the downslope" 
- similarly "downhill side of the slide" -> "downslope"
- "landing with while accelerating" -> "landing while accelerating" (no "with")
- "land here from the LB" -> "land here and trigger the LB"
- "mini-tramp" -> "small ramp" :-)
- "understated parts" -> "downgraded parts"

**A decade of driving**
- “Catch the Turbo” → “**Trigger** the Turbo”
- “use WB and need maximum acceleration” → “Use WB and **accelerate to the max**”.  “need maximum acceleration” might be ok in another sentence but in this context, a strong action word was required to be consistent with the rest of the sentence.
- “Absolutely similar route” → “**Same** route”
- “and help the thruster” → “and help **with** the thrusters” or “and **use** the thrusters”
- “Catch/catching the LB” → “**Trigger/triggering** the LB”
- “You can faster” → “you can **go** faster”
- “in flight” → “in-flight”  (needs a hyphen)

**Rocket Team**
- “on the down of the hill,, not on the up uphill” → “on the downhill, not on the uphill”
- “gain maximum accelerate” → “gain maximum acceleration” (accelerate is a verb, acceleration is the noun)
- “Jump Shocks release in advance” → “release Jump Shocks in advance”
- I liked “activate the boost” 👍.  Maybe even better than engage or trigger in general!
- “Immediately press the accelerate” → “immediately accelerate” (accelerate is a verb)
- “to the mark 750m” → “to the 750m mark”

**Live and Learn**
- “We release the acceleration” → “we stop accelerating”
- “We step on the accelera**tion**” → “we step on the accelera**tor**”
- “Land down on the canister” → “land on the canister”
- “A difficult but passable track” → “a difficult but doable track”
- “Get into this isthmus” → maybe “hole”.  Not sure if isthmus makes sense here, and it is not a common word
- “NOT trigger a perfect start and just keep the acceleration” → “Don’t do a perfect start, and just keep accelerating”
- “release the accelera**tion** or apply the brake” → “release the accelera**tor** or …”

**Hypersonic Hillclimbers**
-  “Step on the acceleration pedal in advance to trigger the turbo” - maybe “early” would be better than “in advance” in general
- “To fly uphill, you need to improve your wings → “… to have upgraded wings”
- “make a jump at the top of the hill”  → “jump at the top of the hill”
- “Not cling” - “not get stuck”

**Salt Mountain**
- “gain acceleration” is not wrong but maybe “accelerate” would be better?
- “…and NOT make the jump” → “… and DO NOT make the jump”
- “Release a little early Jump Shocks…” → “release Jump Shocks a little early…"
- “To give acceleration” → “to gain speed”
- “the higher the speed, the harder it is to drive” - bus cannot “drive” in the air - maybe “use thrusters” instead?
- “Make a hook for the rest of the fuel” → “turn before using the rest of the fuel”
