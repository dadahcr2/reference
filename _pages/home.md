      Points Calculation  
  </summary>  
  
{% capture notice-3 %}	
One season of ~15 matches is just not enough to determine the best HCR2 team.  So I came up with a simple method that takes into account placings from previous seasons.  This should provide a more stable and accurate ranking.  Teams do change over time, so I felt that placings in previous seasons should be less relevant as time passes by.
- ## **Most recent season**: 1st=12 points, 2nd=11 points, 3rd=10 points, … 12th = 1 point
- **Previous season**: 1st=11 points, 2nd=10 points, 3rd=9points, … 11th = 1 point
- **Two seasons ago**: 1st=10 points, 2nd=9 points, 3rd=8points, … 10th = 1 point
I.e. reducing by 1 point the value of each placement for every previous season.  Accordingly, seasons played more than a year ago will not count.
	
In table format: Points awarded according to final placement in previous seasons, where 0 was the final ranks in the last full season,  -1 is one season before, etc. 
```
Season ┃  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

   0   ┃ 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
  -1   ┃ 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
