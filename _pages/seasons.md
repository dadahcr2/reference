   Leagues Stats - Season 3
  </summary>

### Season 3

**How well are teams that were promoted doIng in C.C.?**
Promoted teams are widely regarded as *Shark Fodder* to be chewed up and spat back out to Division 1 after one season.  Is this true?  
	
Well I took a quick look at the Top 50 teams in C.C. to see how many had made there way out of the relegation zone. I found that there were ten from Division 1, placed as follows: 13, 24, 29, 30, 34, 41, 45, 46, 48, 50.  Half of these were still outside the Top 40.
	
Accordingly it appears that of the 50 promoted teams, 40 are likely to be relegated after one season, 5 may just hang in for another season or two, and 5 may be longer term C.C. residents!
	
#### After Match 10

**Season 3 - C.C. - After 10 Matches**
Very peaked distribution of average scores, with thick tails (I call this the Middle Fingersoft Distribution ü§£).  I.e. lots of real strong/weak team and some in the middle too - with few in between. 
Projected Relegation Score for 15 matches is 33900 (average of 2260 per match)  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/858336498159714324/868025040724176906/image0.png)  	

**Season 3 - Div 1 - After 10 Matches**
A very typical bell curve.  Only one team averaging over 4000 per match (Norden Elite).  Small tails suggesting fewer walkover matches.
Assuming 15 matches, projected score for promotion is 46500 (3070 per match average), and a total score of 31125 or less to be relegated (average of 2075)  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/858336498159714324/868027529770991636/image0.png)  

**Season 3 - Div 2 - After 10 Matches**  
A bit of a scewed distribution suggesting many weak teams and few super-strong teams. 
Four teams with averages above 4000 per match headed by T√úRKIYE.
Assuming 15 matches, expected  total score required for promotion is 46200 (average of 3080 per match). Double relegation est.score < 23500 (1570 average) and single relegation est. 30k score (2000 average)  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/858336498159714324/868030387559993404/image0.png)
							
**Comparison of Division Distributions**
Extent of mismatches clear in C.C. given thick tails
Matches are closest in Div 1 with more consistent average scores in general
Div 2 super strong teams as scarce as in Div 1 -  but a heavier preponderance of weaker teams (promotions from Div 4?)  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/858336498159714324/868031654839603250/image0.png)  										   
#### After Match 1 
	
##### **C.C.**
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847866414638432256/861011530815373352/image0.png)  
- After the first match in C.C., the median score was 2259.  This will probably reduce over time assuming some teams are not able to match in future rounds. 
- It is noticeable how uniform the results were spread.  A function of this being based on a single, randomly-allocated match.
- Italy¬≤ came last with 30 cup points - which is not surprising as they are down to 3 members and the leader has <2k gp.  Presumably the members are off to better hunting grounds for the season. How many other teams will do the same? They are unlikely to be the only ones.  It looks like GERMANY was the lucky team that benefited from the easy match!
- With one or two exceptions, the vast majority of lower ranked teams (e.g. 8 of the bottom 10) are imports from Division 1.   Welcome to C.C.!!  

##### **Div 1**  						
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/858336498159714324/861464590512291870/image0.png)  
- The distribution of scores in Division 1 is quite Bell Shaped with most teams scoring between 1000 and 3500.  A sign of very little variation in team strength.
- 499 teams in total.  The bottom two are clearly inactive with 3 player between the two of them.  The unlucky team that was unable to find a match was GermanEmpire.  									
														     
##### **Div 2**  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/858336498159714324/861464783299674112/image0.png)	
- 1997 teams of which 23 did not match
- The triangle-shaped distribution suggest less variation is strength than C.C. - but more than Div. 1.  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/858336498159714324/861492615270760489/image0.png)	

#### Matching
														     
About 30% of Division 1 matched within a 5-10 minute window.  This indicates that many many teams joined the season right as it started.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this has something to do with teams missing out on the 15th match in Season 2?  

With so many teams starting around the same time, I‚Äôm hoping that the matching algorithm will do a better jobü§û

   Leagues Stats - Season 2
  </summary>
### Final Analysis for Season 2 - After 14 Matches
	
The analysis is based on results after 14 matches as many teams missed the matching deadline for the 15th match, and I did not want the results distorted by this.

##### C.C.
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/858336498159714324/859973894400376865/image0.png)  
	
A few observations:
- No teams averaging more than 4000.  This suggests that even the weakest teams have 1 or 2 decent players.
- As many teams 3500- 4000 as 3000-3500.  This lack of tailing-off indicates the population of 10+ super-strong teams that almost always do well.
- There is a big jump in the number of teams from those scoring 0-1000  to those scoring 1000-2000.  I would imagine there are about 10 teams that have not even been trying - with players departing to other teams only to return at the end of season?
- The dividing line between top 50 and bottom 50 is approximately 2180 average score	
	
##### Division I	
	
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/858336498159714324/859974241780498442/image0.png)  
	
- Fairly large proportion of teams scoring between 1500 and 3000 suggesting a lot of competitive matches
- A few very strong teams (3) averaging above 4000 that should do fine in CC. but the rest may struggle more. 
- Probably 100 teams that belong in Division 2 but another 100 being demoted that will dominate in Div 2 and be back the next month.
- Teams averaging less than 2000 will be demoted.
- Teams averaging above approx 3000 will be promoted

##### Division II
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/858336498159714324/859974598089768980/image0.png)  

- Very few teams scoring above 4000 suggesting a lack of C.C. level strong teams.
- Only 50 or so teams averaging above 3500.  The other 150 being promoted may struggle in Div 1.
- Fairly normal looking histogram otherwise
- Average of about 2425 or above required to be promoted,
- Average of less than 2000 to be demoted, and less than 1440 to be double-demoted

##### Comparison between Division Distributions
	
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/858336498159714324/859974895991128084/image0.png)  
	
### Season 2 - 11 Matches
	
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847866414638432256/857756339824492564/image0.png)
- After 11 matches, the relegation demarcation is roughly 2215 average score
- For C.C., there are more teams averaging 3000-3500 than 2500-3000, which may indicate two separate population groups. I.e. the super-teams vs the rest. This property is called heteroscedasticity.  And that is your stats lesson for the day üòÅ

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847867054635876383/857756404277051432/image0.png)
- So after 11 matches, it looks like relegation for those with <2040 average score, and promotion for those averaging 3150 or more (roughly)
- it will be interesting to see if this changes going into season end - or if some marginal teams will decline to play.

### Season 1
								    
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847866414638432256/849385276241608744/image0.png)

- 10 abandoned teams!
- Max points is 4526 for 100 players, split between the two teams.  However. many teams are not full (and a few may not match) so total points will be less on average, say 4500. Accordingly averaging at least half this (2250) should be enough to not get demoted (but no guarantee).  Therefore, assuming 15 matches over the season, a total of 2250x15=33750 may be enough to be in the top 50, and thus avoid relegation.  Best of luck!
