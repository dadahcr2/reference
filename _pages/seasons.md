### Final Analysis for Season 2 - After 14 Matches
	
The analysis is based on results after 14 matches as many teams missed the matching deadline for the 15th match, and I did not want the results distorted by this.

##### C.C.

A few observations:
- No teams averaging more than 4000.  This suggests that even the weakest teams have 1 or 2 decent players.
- As many teams 3500- 4000 as 3000-3500.  This lack of tailing-off indicates the population of 10+ super-strong teams that almost always do well.
- There is a big jump in the number of teams from those scoring 0-1000  to those scoring 1000-2000.  I would imagine there are about 10 teams that have not even been trying - with players departing to other teams only to return at the end of season?
- The dividing line between top 50 and bottom 50 is approximately 2180 average score

##### Division I

- Fairly large proportion of teams scoring between 1500 and 3000 suggesting a lot of competitive matches
- A few very strong teams (3) averaging above 4000 that should do fine in CC. but the rest may struggle more. 
- Probably 100 teams that belong in Division 2 but another 100 being demoted that will dominate in Div 2 and be back the next month.
- Teams averaging less than 2000 will be demoted.
- Teams averaging above approx 3000 will be promoted

##### Division II
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/858336498159714324/859974598089768980/image0.png)  

- Very few teams scoring above 4000 suggesting a lack of C.C. level strong teams.
- Only 50 or so teams averaging above 3500.  The other 150 being promoted may struggle in Div 1.
- Fairly normal looking histogram otherwise
- Average of about 2425 or above required to be promoted,
- Average of less than 2000 to be demoted, and less than 1440 to be double-demoted

##### Comparison between Division Distributions

### Season 2 - 11 Matches

- After 11 matches, the relegation demarcation is roughly 2215 average score
- For C.C., there are more teams averaging 3000-3500 than 2500-3000, which may indicate two separate population groups. I.e. the super-teams vs the rest. This property is called heteroscedasticity.  And that is your stats lesson for the day üòÅ

- So after 11 matches, it looks like relegation for those with <2040 average score, and promotion for those averaging 3150 or more (roughly)
- it will be interesting to see if this changes going into season end - or if some marginal teams will decline to play.								 

### Season 1

- 10 abandoned teams!
- Max points is 4526 for 100 players, split between the two teams.  However. many teams are not full (and a few may not match) so total points will be less on average, say 4500. Accordingly averaging at least half this (2250) should be enough to not get demoted (but no guarantee).  Therefore, assuming 15 matches over the season, a total of 2250x15=33750 may be enough to be in the top 50, and thus avoid relegation.  Best of luck!
