Is it ok for me to make a few English suggestions for you to keep in mind for your tutorials.  The words you use make sense but there are sometimes other words that would be used more commonly?

- Rather than “obligatory”, use “necessary”

- “Penultimate” → “second best” or  “second highest”

- “clamp” → “step on”

Was definitely an improvement this week especially not using “clamp” 👍

- “make a flip back” → “make a backflip”
- “passage” → “route”
- “get acceleration” → “accelerate”

I hope you don’t mind my English suggestions 😁
Here are a few minor comments:

- In general, “accelerate” is a verb.  As a noun use “acceleration” e.g. “good acceleration” -  or “accelerator” if referring to the thing that leads to acceleration.
- “With a Slight deviation backwards” → “leaning slightly backwards”
- “With step on accelerate” → “while accelerating”
- “We step on accelerate” → “we accelerate” or “we step on gas” or “we step on the accelerator” (English is not an easy language. The way you phrased it was not too bad.)
 - “Hillock” → “hill” or “small hill” (hillock is not a commonly used word)
- “flew” is past tense.  Use “fly” if present tense.

The English was pretty good this week 👍 - a few very minor points
- “make a tilt” → “tilt”
- for CC-EV it is called “boost” and not “momentum” in the game
- “step on two pedals” → “step on both pedals” - “two” is ok but might imply that there are more than two in total.
